# HandSynth on a Rainy Day

A web-based instrument inspired by rainy days, using the MediaPipe hand detection system and Three.js.

## Installation

Run this followed commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

After launching and pressing the start button, please allow camera and sound access if needed. Raise your hand in front of the camera and use your thumb and index finger or middle finger to pinch objects. The height of the objects corresponds to the pitch of the sound, and the sound will play when the light blue bar intersects with the objects. The size of the cat changes according to the background music. 

Press the 's' key on the keyboard to switch the background and music.
